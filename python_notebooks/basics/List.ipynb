    "A **list** is a collection of items where each item holds a relative position with respect to the others. More specifically, we will refer to this type of list as an unordered list. We can consider the list as having a first item, a second item, a third item, and so on. We can also refer to the beginning of the list (the first item) or the end of the list (the last item). For simplicity we will assume that lists cannot contain duplicate items."
