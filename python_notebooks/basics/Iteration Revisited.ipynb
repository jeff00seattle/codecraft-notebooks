We’ve already seen the **`for`** statement in a previous chapter. This is a very common form of iteration in Python. In this chapter we are going to look at the **`while`** statement — another way to have your program do iteration."

For example, to compute the sum of the first n integers, we could create a for loop using the **range** to produce the numbers 1 thru n. Using the accumulator pattern, we can start with a running total variable initialized to 0 and on each iteration, add the current value of the loop variable. A function to compute this sum is shown below."

Similar to the if statement, it uses a boolean expression to control the flow of execution. The body of while will be repeated as long as the controlling boolean expression evaluates to True.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can use the while loop to create any type of iteration we wish, including anything that we have previously done with a for loop. For example, the program in the previous section could be rewritten using while. Instead of relying on the range function to produce the numbers for our summation, we will need to produce them ourselves. To to this, we will create a variable called aNumber and initialize it to 1, the first number in the summation. Every iteration will add aNumber to the running total until all the values have been used. In order to control the iteration, we must create a boolean expression that evaluates to True as long as we want to keep adding values to our running total. In this case, as long as aNumber is less than or equal to the bound, we should keep going."
