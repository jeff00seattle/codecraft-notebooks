    "**Recursion** is a method of solving problems that involves breaking a problem down into smaller and smaller subproblems until you get to a small enough problem that it can be solved trivially. Usually recursion involves a function calling itself. While it may not seem like much on the surface, recursion allows us to write elegant solutions to problems that may otherwise be very difficult to program."

The function uses an accumulator variable (theSum) to compute a running total of all the numbers in the list by starting with 0 and adding each number in the list."
