    "A normal Python function will always return one value, whether it be a list, an integer or some other object. But what if you wanted to be able to call a function and have it yield a series of values? That is where generators come in. A generator works by “saving” where it last left off (or yielding) and giving the calling function a value. So instead of returning the execution to the caller, it just gives temporary control back. To do this magic, a generator function requires Python’s `yield` statement.\n",
